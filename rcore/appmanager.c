/*
    Heres what is going down. We are going to load the app header file from flash
    This contains sizes and offsets. The app bin sits directly after the app header.
    Then we load the app itself as well as the header block (for future reference)
    
    There is a symbol table in each Pebble app that needs to have the address 
    of _our_ symbol table poked into it. 
    The symbol table is a big lookup table of pointer functions. When an app calls aa function
    such as window_create() it actually turns that into an integer id in the app.
    When the app calls the function, it does function => id => RebbleOS => id to function => call
    This allows the app to do a lookup of a function id internally, check it in our rebble sym table, and return a pointer address to to the function to jump to.
    
    We also have to take care of BSS section. This is defined int he app header for the size, 
    and sits directly after the app binary. We alocate enough room for the BSS, and zero it out
    BSS. is always zeroed.
    
    Then we set the Global Offset Table (GOT). Each Pebble app is compiled with
    Position Independant code (PIC) that means it can run from any address.
    This is usually used on dlls .so files and the like, and a Pebble app is no different
    It is the responsibility of the dynamic loader (us in this case) to get
    the GOT (which is at the end of the binary) and relocate all of the data symbols
    in the application binary.
    The got is a clever way of doing relative lookups in the app for "shared" data.
    
    http://grantcurell.com/2015/09/21/what-is-the-symbol-table-and-what-is-the-global-offset-table/
    
    In short, the app header defines how many relocations of memory we need to do, and where in the bin
    these relocation registers are. 
    The loader does this:
    load GOT from end of binary using header offset value. for each entry, 
    get the position in memory for our GOT lookup table
    The value in the got table inside the .DATA section is updated to add the base address
    of the executing app to the relative offset already stored in the register.
    It is usual in a shred lib to have a shared data section between all apps. The data is copied
    to a separate location for each instance. 
    In this case we aer using the .DATA section in place. No sharing. no clever. Not required.
    
    When thwe app executes, any variables stored in the global are looked up...
    int global_a;
    printf(global_a);
    > go to the GOT in the DATA section by relative address and get the address of global_a
    > go to the address of global_a in data section
    > this is the allocated memory for globals
    > retrieve value
    
    NOTE: once we have relocated, we don't need the loaded header GOT any more, so we can delete it
    in fact the bss section will zero over it.
    
    For now, the statically allocated memory for the app task is also used
    to load the application into. The application needs uint8 size to execute 
    from, while the stack is uint32. The stack is therefore partitioned into 
    fixed_memory_for_app[n] = [ app binary | GOT || BSS | heap++....  | ...stack ]
    
    The entry point given to the task (that spawns the app) is the beginning of the
    stack region, after the app binary. The relative bin and stack are then 
    unioned through as the right sizes to the BX and the SP.
    The app deals with 8 bit bytes where the staack is a word of uint32. To use the same array,
    the value is unioned sto save epic bitshifting
    
    We are leaning on Rtos here to actually spawn the app with it's own stack
    (cheap fork)  and make sure the (M)SP is set accordingly. 
    As a bonus we can manipulate this task in FreeRTOS directly through it's 
    TCB handle (suspen, kill, delete)
    
    Steps:
    * Find app on flash
    * Load app into lower stack
    * Set symbol table address
    * load relocs and reloc the GOT
    * zero BSS
    * fork
